        "Nasa has been observing space for the last several decades using ever more sophisticated space telescopes. They have used these telescopes to determine and confirm that other planets exist around other stars in our galaxy and beyond. One of these Space telescopes The Keplar Space Telescope has been instrumental in identifying many objects of interest outside our solar system. Many of these objects of Intrest have been confirmed planets by Nasa. This data can be hard to interoperate and with new planets popping up every so often it is hard to generate a real understanding of the process involved in identifying planets. Today we usually we get a NASA press release on page 37 of some odd journal claiming the discovery of a new planet. There is little in the way of public knowledge regarding the process of determining if an identified object is a planet and what the limits of the current technology are."

        "The data from these two sources will be converted into two separate dataframes before any other work is done in our analysis? I will be trying to determine if there is any positive correlation between the two tables to see if there are any data points in the two tables that may provide insight as to how and Why Nasa determines that a KOI object is a planet. I will also be determining the mean and min of the mass of all planets discovered by Kepler to determine if the Telescope has trouble locating smaller objects and planets. I will be using a correlation matrix on selected fields to determine and visualize the relationship between different data points. This will allow us to better determine what data points contribute to NASA confirming a KOI object as a planet. I will be using a box plot and histogram to determine the spread of the mass of the planets. This will be compared with the mass of objects in our solar system to determine the lower limit on the mass of planets Kepler can identify."
